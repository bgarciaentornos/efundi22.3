	<p><strong>How this Content Collection is Structured</strong></p>
	<p>This content collection presents a menu of plug-in technology options, as well as access to this Welcome. Within each of the plug-in technology examples an internal menu is displayed which contains the following:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>JavaScript &ndash; content that explains how the plug-in technology uses JavaScript to communicate with an LMS-provided API Instance and the specific JavaScript calls that are important for that particular technology </li>
	  <li>API &ndash; content that explains how the JavaScript detects the LMS-provided API Instance which allows communication to be initialized with the LMS and code that demonstrates the actual communication </li>
	  <li>Data Model Elements &ndash; example content that explains three data model elements, Comments From Learner, Interactions and Objectives, an example activity that demonstrates the element, the code used to implement the element in each of the included Plug-In Technologies and what the communication looks like with the LMS. </li>
